# Use DOM selectors to register Angular Classy controllers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davej/classy-registerSelector.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/davej/classy-registerSelector)

This feature is stolen from AngularDart (you may also be familiar with it from Backbone and other MVC frameworks). It's best explained with code.

This is how you would typically bind a controller to a view with Angular Classy:

```html
<!-- In your HTML -->
<div id="footer" ng-controller="FooterCtrl"></div>
```
```javascript
// In your JS
app.classy.controller({
  name: 'FooterCtrl',
  //...
});
```

With the `register-selector` plugin you can reverse-reference controllers using CSS-style selectors instead of a name, like this:

```html
<!-- In your HTML -->
<div id="footer"></div>
```
```javascript
// In your JS
app.classy.controller({
  el: '#footer',
  //...
});
```

If available jQuery will be used as the selector engine, otherwise it will fallback to document.querySelectorAll.


## Install

Install with `bower`:

```shell
bower install classy-register-selector
```

Add to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/angular-classy/angular-classy.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/classy-registerSelector/classy-register-selector.js"></script>
```

Add `classy` and `classy-registerSelector` to your application module.

```javascript
var app = angular.module('app', ['classy', 'classy-register-selector']);
```

## Running Tests
